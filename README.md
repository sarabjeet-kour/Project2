Insurance-Price-prediction-Dashboard

Analyze a dataset related to insurance pricing to create an insightful Power BI dashboard. The goal of
this project is to visualize key trends and factors that influence the predicted insurance charges for
individuals based on demographic and lifestyle data.

Dataset Overview:
The dataset contains various details about individuals, including age, gender, BMI, number of
children, smoking habits, region, medical and family medical history, exercise frequency, occupation,
coverage level, and their corresponding insurance charges.

Tasks:
• Visualize Insurance Charges Distribution:
Create a visualization that shows the distribution of insurance charges across different individuals.
Highlight the average insurance charges based on age, gender, and region.

• Analyze Health and Lifestyle Impact:
Visualize the relationship between BMI, smoking habits, and insurance charges.
Create a chart to show how medical history (e.g., diabetes, high blood pressure) impacts insurance
premiums.

• Study the Role of Occupation and Coverage Level:
Compare insurance charges across different occupations (e.g., blue collar, white collar).
Analyze how different coverage levels (e.g., standard, premium) affect the insurance charges.

• Examine Family and Exercise Factors:
Create visualizations that show the influence of family medical history and exercise frequency on
insurance charges.
Identify any patterns indicating that certain exercise habits or family health history affect insurance
costs.
